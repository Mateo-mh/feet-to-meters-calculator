# feet-to-meters-calculator
In this exercise I made a calculator from feet to meters, using python and tkinter, this is one of the exercises I did to practice tkinter.

This is my first application in tkinter with python, it is relatively simple, to run the app just do the following:

1) clone the repository using "git clone plus the repository url"
2) through your terminal enter the folder called feet-to-meters-calculator
3) Once you have entered the folder through the terminal, execute the following command:on windows: python calculator-feet-meters.py - on macOS: python3 calculator-feet-meters.py
4) Done! You can now use this simple application
